Provides access to information about the user's system.

##### love.system.getOS()
Returns the operating system which LoveDOS is running on.

##### love.system.getMemUsage()
Returns the amount of memory in kilobytes which is being used by LoveDOS. This
includes the memory used by both the loaded assets and lua.


### love.graphics
Provides functions for drawing lines, shapes, text and images.

##### love.graphics.getDimensions()
Returns the width and height of the screen in pixels as two numbers.

##### love.graphics.getWidth()
Returns the width of the screen in pixels.

##### love.graphics.getHeight()
Returns the height of the screen in pixels.

##### love.graphics.getBackgroundColor()
Returns the currently set background color.

##### love.graphics.setBackgroundColor(red, green, blue)
Sets the the background color used when `love.graphics.clear()` is called
without any arguments. If called with no arguments the back color is set to
black.

##### love.graphics.getColor()

##### love.graphics.setColor(red, green, blue)
Sets the the color used when drawing. If called with no arguments the color is
set to white.

##### love.graphics.getBlendMode()
Returns the currently set blend mode.

##### love.graphics.setBlendMode([mode])
Sets the current blend mode used by `love.graphics.draw()`. If no `mode`
argument is passed then the blend mode is set to the default (`"normal"`).

Mode        | Description
------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
`"normal"`  | Draws normally with transparency
`"fast"`    | Draws without transparency, this is the fastest blend mode
`"and"`     | Binary ANDs the source and destination pixels
`"or"`      | Binary ORs the source and destination pixels
`"color"`   | Draws opaque pixels using the `love.graphics.setColor()` color

##### love.graphics.getFont()
Returns the current font.

##### love.graphics.setFont([font])
Sets the current font. If `font` is nil then the font is reset to the default.

##### love.graphics.getCanvas()
Returns the current canvas.

##### love.graphics.setCanvas([image])
Sets the current canvas which all the draw operations will draw to. If the
`image` argument is not set then the canvas is reset to the default canvas
representing the user's screen.

##### love.graphics.reset()
Resets the font, color, background color, canvas, blend mode and flip mode to
their defaults.

##### love.graphics.clear(red, green, blue)
Clears the screen (or canvas) to the color. If no color argument is given
then the background color is used (see `love.graphics.setBackgroundColor()`).

##### love.graphics.draw(image [, quad] [, x [, y [, flip]]])
Draws the `image` to the screen at the given `x`, `y` position. If a `quad`
argument is provided then the image is clipped to the provided quad when drawn.
If `flip` is true then the image is flipped horizontally.

##### love.graphics.point(x, y)
Draws a pixel.

##### love.graphics.line(x, y, x2, y2 [, ...])
Draws a line from the positition `x`, `y` to `x2`, `y2`. You can continue
passing point positions to draw a polyline.

##### love.graphics.rectangle(mode, x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectange and the `x`, `y` position of the given `width` and `height`.
`mode` should be either `"fill"` or `"line"`.

##### love.graphics.circle(mode, x, y, radius)
Draws a circle of a given `radius` with its center at the `x`, `y` position.
`mode` should be either `"fill"` or `"line"`.

##### love.graphics.print(text, x, y)
Draws the `text` string in the current font with its top left at the `x`, `y`
position.

##### love.graphics.newImage(filename)
Creates and returns a new image. `filename` should be the name of an image file.
LoveDOS is limited to a palette of 255 unique colors in any given game; it is up
to the user not to exceed this limit.

##### love.graphics.newCanvas([width, height])
Creates and returns a new blank image of the size `width`, `height`. If a
`width` and `height` are not provided then the image will be the same
dimensions as the screen.

##### love.graphics.newQuad(x, y, width, height)
Creates and returns a new quad.

##### love.graphics.newFont([filename ,] ptsize)
Creates and returns a new font. `filename` should be the name of a ttf file and
`ptsize` its size. If no `filename` is provided the built in font is used.

##### love.graphics.present()
Flips the current screen buffer with the displayed screen buffer. This is
called automatically after the `love.draw()` callback.


### love.timer
Provides an interface to your system's clock.

##### love.timer.getDelta()
Returns the time between the last two frames.

##### love.timer.getAverageDelta()
Returns the average delta time over the last second.

##### love.timer.getFps()
Returns the current frames per second

##### love.timer.getTime()
Returns the number of seconds since some time in the past. The value returned
by this function should be used only as a comparison with other values returned
by this function.

##### love.timer.step()
Measures the time between two frames. This is automatically called each frame.

##### love.timer.sleep(seconds)
Pauses the thread for the specified number of `seconds`. During this time no
callbacks are called.


### love.keyboard
##### love.keyboard.isDown(key, ...)
Returns true if any of the given keys are currently pressed.

##### love.keyboard.setKeyRepeat(enable)
Dictates whether repeat `keypressed` events should occur if a key is held down.
By default this is `false`.

At the moment only one file and audio format is supported: 16 bit signed PCM mono WAVE files at 22050Hz. Everything else
will result in a load error.


### love.sound.mix()
Must be called once per frame to mix the playing audio sources for submission to the soundblaster driver.
It's automatically called by the default love.run() implementation.


## Objects

`love.graphics.setFont()` function.

##### Font:getWidth(text)
Returns the width in pixels that the `text` string would take when printed using
this font.

##### Font:getHeight()
Returns the height of the font in pixels.


### Source
A sound source used by the audio subsystem.

## Callbacks
##### love.load(args)
Called when LoveDOS is started. `args` is a table containing the command line
arguments passed to LoveDOS.

##### love.update(dt)
Called at the beginning of each frame, `dt` is the amount of time in seconds
which has passed since the last frame. This is where all the game logic should
take place.

##### love.draw()
Called when the frame is ready to be drawn. All your draw calls should take
place in this function.

##### love.keypressed(key, code, isrepeat)
Called when the user presses a key. `key` is the key that was pressed, `code` is
the scancode of the pressed key, `isrepeat` is true if this key press event is a
repeat.

##### love.keyreleased(key, code)
Called when the user releases a key. `key` is the key that was released, `code`
is the scancode for the released key.

##### love.textinput(text)
Called when text has been entered by the user. For example if shift-2 is pressed
on an American keyboard layout, the text "@" will be generated.

##### love.mousemoved(x, y, dx, dy)
Called when the user moves the mouse. `x` and `y` are the mouse's current
position, `dx` and `dy` is the amount moved relative to the last mouse position.

##### love.mousepressed(x, y, button)
Called when the user presses a mouse button. `x` and `y` are the mouse's current
position. `button` is the value `1` (left), `2` (right) or `3` (middle).

##### love.mousereleased(x, y, button)
Called when the user releases a mouse button. `x` and `y` are the mouse's
current position. `button` is the value `1` (left), `2` (right) or `3` (middle).

##### love.errhand(err)
Called when an unprotected error occurs; `err` is the error message. By default
this function displays the error message and stacktrace on screen and waits for
the `escape` key to be pressed before exiting.
